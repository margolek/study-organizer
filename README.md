## Study Organizer

Have you ever been frustrated with scrolling messenger conversation in order to find important information? I also felt that
pain so I decided to create own web-based app to keep everything about studying in one place. After registration proccess you have posibility to create own group or join to existing one. Do not panic when you forget your password or login. I show you how to utilize gmail account to password reset. In group you can start new topic or comment existing.

If you want to run app in your local machine follow step by step next paragraph
